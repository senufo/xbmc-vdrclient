Installation of the VDR Python Library
--------------------------------------

vdrpylib is packaged with the Python distutils distribution
utilities. In order to install vdrpylib follow these steps:

1. extract the vdrpylib archive to a directory of your choice.
2. change into the vdrpylib directory created when extracting the
   archive.
3. start the library installation by running the command
   python setup.py install
   at your command line. This install the library into the proper
   location where Python keeps third-party libraries.


Running Included Applications
-----------------------------

You can invoke applications coming with the library by typing:
python app/app.py
at your command line. In order to run e.g. expg, type:
python expg/expg.py <options>
By setting the file permissions of expg.py to executable you can
call it directly like a shell script.


Developing with vdrpylib
------------------------

To utilize vdrpylib in your program, import the classes from the vdr
package as follows:

import vdr.svdrp

Each first level class resides in its own module. The module name is
always the lowercase class name. You can instantiate and use classes
as in the following example:

import vdr.svdrp
s = vdr.svdrp.SVDRP('localhost')
print s.write_cmd('lstc')
s.write('quit\n')
s.close()
